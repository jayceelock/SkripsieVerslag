\section{System Performance}

In the final system, both QR Code and NFC technology, as well as Stellenbosch University
(SU) cards, have been implemented. It was found that the NFC and SU cards options have the
fastest transaction time between product selection and when the product is dispensed.
However, the NFC option is currently limited to cellphones that have NFC antennas and are
based on the Android Operating System and the SU card option currently has no limited
user verification facility and cannot keep track of a customer's current balance.

It was found that the QR Code payment option typically has a slower transaction time. This
is mainly due to some hardware bottlenecks of the Pi. These bottlenecks include the
Raspberry Pi's moderate processing power, which increases the encryption time and the
time it takes the Pi to process and decode a live video stream from the webcam. These
bottlenecks may be improved with hardware modifications and processor overclocking. Extra
work can also go into optimising the code to make it run more efficiently. This can be
done by converting the code into compiled machine code, such as C or C++.

Furthermore, a server has been made that runs in the computing cloud. This server
interacts with a customer's cellphone through the Android NFC application that was made
or the cellphone's internet browser. All data transactions between the server and the
customer's cellphone are encrypted with an asymmetric encryption scheme with extra layers
of security added.

Lastly, a working demonstration VM was designed and made. It houses all of
the VM components and allows a customer to buy one of two products using
his cellphone. 

\section{Future Work}

The VM system that has been designed in this project has been designed to
work as planned. With that being said, there is potential to expand upon the work that has
been completed thus far.

This section discusses some improvements and additions that can be made to this
system.

\subsection{Commercialisation}

The VM currently uses faux money which has no real-world value. Therefore,
the system in its current state is not ready to be deployed across Stellenbosch
University's campus. 

To commercialise the VM, third-party payment providers, such
as PayPal or PayPoint, can be integrated into the system. This will allow customers to
buy credits to use on the VM system by using their credit cards. 

All the transactions take place electronically and will therefore be integratable with the
current system. 

Furthermore, the memory leakage issue discussed in Sec. \ref{sec:memory_leak} will need
to be addressed and fixed.

\subsection{Polish}

This project focused on the practical and functional aspects of the complete system and
almost no attention was given to the aesthetics of the complete system. Therefore, some
extra work can go into making the web server and Android NFC application more pleasant to use. 

\subsection{Integration}

One important aspect that must be focused on to increase the odds of making this project
more commercially successful, is its integration with current VMs, i.e.
adding a cashless option to current VMs that are restricted to cash.

\subsection{More Payment Options}

Some work can go into expanding the number of payment options available to the user.
Some options that may be considered are Bluetooth, Instant Messaging (such as WhatsApp,
BlackBerry Messenger and MXit) and Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD).
