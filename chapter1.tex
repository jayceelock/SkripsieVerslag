\section{Problem Statement}

The Vending Machines (VMs) currently used at Stellenbosch University (SU) exclusively
make use of cash transactions. These VM systems are currently the
de facto standard throughout the world, but they do have one drawback:
they require a hard cash transaction to take place. In a world moving away from
cash transactions and towards online payments, e-transactions and mobile
payments, this may become a problem to potential customers. With that in mind, a need has
been identified at SU for a VM that accepts cashless transactions.

\section{Existing Solutions}

Currently there are cashless payment solutions being used by the general public.
These include debit and credit cards, Radio Field Identification (RFID) cards,
Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) based systems and, more recently, Near
Field Communication (NFC) payments. These alternatives are further discussed in this
section.

\subsection{Credit and Debit Cards}

A familiar and widely-used alternative to cash payments are the debit and
credit cards most modern adults possess. This is especially
true in developed countries with mature and reliable financial institutions.

The advantages these cards hold over the other cashless options are
that they are easy to obtain and that they have become very
reliable and simple to use. A disadvantage is that debit and credit systems may become
costly and complicated to implement. This is very true for the simple system developed in
this project.

\subsection{Radio Field Identification}

RFID is a technology which was first patented in 1983
[\cite{patent:nfc-patent}]. Since then, the technology has grown and matured into a very
reliable identification and payment platform. Examples of where this is used are the
payments made to new parking meters with a contactless card.

The advantage of this technology is its great convenience: a customer only needs
to tap the card against a receiver and it is not required that a password be
entered.

However, this leads to some security concerns. For example, if the card gets stolen
or cloned, the thief can use the money on the card for his own benefit.
Fortunately, these cards most commonly work with pre-paid money.
Therefore, provided that there was not too much money loaded onto the card, the
theft victim will not suffer a financial loss greater than if cash were stolen. 

\subsection{Unstructured Supplementary Service Data}

USSD is a communication standard used by cellphones to exchange data with a
service provider's servers. If the service provider allows it, USSD may be used by a customer to make financial transfers. 

An example of this is the M-Pesa mobile money service in Kenya, which is based on USSD.
It allows a customer to pay for goods ranging from milk to bread and even the monthly
rent. It is currently regarded as the most advanced and popular mobile payment platform
in the world [\cite{journal:m-pesa}].

An advantage of implementing such a system is that it has been proven to be reliable and
is usable by almost any cellphone. The disadvantage is that it requires third party
vendors, such as the mobile service providers, to provide systems and services. This may
add unnecessary overhead costs to the system.

\subsection{Near Field Communication}

NFC payments have recently come to the fore as a
prominent method of making cashless transactions. In Europe and North
America there have been significant advances in making this payment method a
more attractive payment option. Google has been making large contributions with
the addition of NFC protocols to its Android platform
[\cite{website:android-gingerbread}].

Some examples of NFC based payments are the London public transport system, which makes
provision for NFC payments [\cite{article:nfc-underground}], as well as some retail vendors
which accept payments made via Google's Wallet application.

\section{Goal of the Final System}
\label{sec:final-system-goal}

Hard cash still remains the largest contributor to global financial transactions,
standing at 59\% of the 37 billion transactions that took place in 2012
[\cite{article:money-transactions}, \cite{website:money-transactions}]. However,
mobile and card transactions are expected to surpass cash as the leading
payment method by 2015 [\cite{article:cashless-transactions}].

To this end, mobile payments, i.e. payments made with a cellphone, was chosen
as the medium to facilitate cashless payments for this VM.
Therefore, the final goal of this project is to deliver a VM
that can be used on SU's campus and will allow anyone to buy products from
the VM using only their cellphones.

\section{System Objectives}
\label{sec:objectives}

The system objectives are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The system must make provision for both NFC and Quick Response Code-based payments.
  \item The system must make use of a web server based in the cloud that must be accessible by anyone across the world.
  \item A cellphone application must be created that will allow transactions to be
  completed using NFC.
  \item A demonstration model VM must be designed and constructed.
  \item All the data transfers between the user's cellphone and the server must be
  encrypted.
  \item Extra layers of security must be added to prevent theft and product
  loss.
\end{itemize}

\section{Report Structure}

In this report, Chapter \ref{chap:2} gives background information on all the
technology, concepts and programs used in this project. Thereafter, Chapter
\ref{chap:3} discusses the overall system design, which is followed by
a discussion on the detailed design of the software and hardware aspects of the
entire system in Chapters \ref{chap:4} and \ref{chap:5}. Afterwards in
Chapter \ref{chap:6}, the system test results are discussed and analysed,
which is followed by a discussion on the complete system. Finally, the project conclusion
is given in Chapter \ref{chap:7}.
