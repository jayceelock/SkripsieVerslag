Because the Arduino version of this shield is locally available, and the cost issues related
to importing a NFC chip that is made for the Raspberry Pi, the Arduino version was bought for 
R780.00. Its Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL) serial interface was configured in such a way
so that it can serially communicate with the Raspberry Pi's UART interface. It can be powered
by the 5V output pin from the Raspberry Pi.
